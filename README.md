# Java-Mini-Project
# Topic : Hospital Bed Management system

# OBJECTIVE:
Hospital Bed management system is an organized computerized system designed to deal with day-today operations of hospital beds. However, when running a large medical centre or chain of hospitals,
we understand that bed tracking is more challenging than it seems. Poor bed visibility, delayed bed
maintenance, and a lack of centralized information can make tracking available beds difficult. Some
of the challenges faced by the hospitals today are use of manual system for the management and
maintenance of critical information. One can easily find out if a specific bed is available in a ward.By
automating hospital bed management systems and providing bed visibility, clinical staff are no longer
forced to rely on outdated information or error-prone manual records.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The hospital bed management is designed for hospital to replace their existing manual system. The
new system is to control the following information: patient information, room availability and bed
visibility. These services are provided in graphic user interface in an efficient manner to reduce the
time and resources currently required for such tasks. The program can look after inpatients and
outpatientâ€™s records, storing patient details into the system. Additionally, central bed management
agencies can spend more time communicating with units about the needs of admitted patients, as
they no longer need to physically travel to various locations within the hospital to confirm bed
availability.

We have made this desktop application using javafx scenebuilder for ui desiging, mysql workbench for database and intelliJ Idea  for connectivity.
